 Challenges
 
 - This VC is intended to show the vAtom in 'activated' view mode.
 - I would like for the activated state to be a differenct view controller. However, there must be continuity between
 the Inventory View Controller and the ActivatedViewController.
 - Options:
 1. The ActiavtedVC has a new VatomView and the vatom pack and the fsp are passed in.
 2. The ActivatedVC displays the same VatomView (i.e. has a reference to the VatomView), all that changes is the fsp is
 set to .actiavted. This may be a better solution interms of continuity and in terms of memory.
